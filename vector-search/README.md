Search term: `funny movies with lead characters that are not human` 
- involves a semantic search that understands the meaning to retrieve relevant movie recommendations and not just the keywords in the dataset

- `Vector embeddings`: a list of floating point numbers
- `Vector`: represents a point in an `n` dimensional space, that captures semantic information about the text it represents
- example model: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 will create a 384 floating point numbers for any text
- `Vector search`: 
  - ability to find related objects that have related similarity, searching the database on meaning rather than on keywords
  - uses machine learning models to transform unstructured data (like text, audio, images, video) into numberic representations called `Vector embeddings`
  - find related data by comparing the distances between these vector embeddings
