## 10 - MongoDB Logging Basics

### MongoDB Logs in Atlas

- Downloading logs requires the following role or greater in MongoDB Atlas
  - `Project Data Access Read Only` (`GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_ONLY`)

```bash
atlas auth login
# determine if your Atlas user has this role,
atlas project users list -o json

# download logs command
atlas logs download <hostname> <mongodb.gz|mongos.gz|mongosqld.gz|mongodb-audit-log.gz|mongos-audit-log.gz> [flags]

# download the mongod log file for the past 30 days from the primary node of your Atlas cluster,
atlas logs download uml3-shard-00-00.xwgj1.mongodb.net mongodb.gz
# download of mongodb.log.gz completed
gunzip mongodb.log.gz
```

### MongoDB Logs in Self Managed Instances

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/program/mongod/#std-option-mongod.--logpath

```bash
# On Linux by default the MongoDB log file is found in the following directory:
/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

# if the log file is not in its default location, check the mongod.conf file to determine if an alternate path was provided.
sudo cat /etc/mongod.conf

# show recent global log messages from the RAM cache in mongosh, default is 'global'
 show log <type>
# To view the available filters that can be provided to the show log helper
show logs
[ 'global', 'startupWarnings' ]

# The mongosh helper show log global internally calls the getLog command to return recent log messages from the RAM cache:
db.adminCommand( { getLog:'global'} )
```

### MongoDB Log events

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/log-messages/

- Logs are stored in the `mongodb.log` file as stractured JSON, varying length depending on the type of the event

Log events:
- Connections
- Commands
- Queries
- Storage
- Replication

```bash
# mongodb log message pretty printed
{
  "t": {
    "$date": "2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"
  },
  "s": "I",
  "c": "NETWORK",
  "id": 12345,
  "ctx": "listener",
  "svc": "R",
  "msg": "Listening on",
  "attr": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1"
  }
}
```

- `mongod.log` file as structured JSON
  - information what is taking place in the database
  - `s` severity field, `F`, `E`, `W`, `I`, `D` (D1-D5)
  - `c` component field, `COMMAND`, `ACCESS`, `STORAGE`, `INDEX`, `NETWORK`, `REPL`, `CONTROL`
  - `ctx` context field, operation thread
  - `msg` field, generated by the component originator
  - `attr` attribute field with more information
  - `tags` some log messages have this property which is an array of strings, you can use for
    filtering (`show log startupWarnings`)

- example of log messages:
  - OS-level warnings
    - ex: `vm.max_map_count` is too low
  - authorization attempts
    - user attempt to modify or access a resource that they not have been granted access to
    - `c`: `ACCESS`
  - replica set elections
    - `c`: `REPL`
    - `msg`: 'Replica set state transition'

### MongoDB Server log customizations 

- profiling can have a negative impact on performance and disk space --> do it on non-prod cluster

`db.setProfilingLevel()` - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.setprofilinglevel/

```bash
# The profiler level:
# - 0 to disable profiling completely
# - 1 for profiling operations that take longer than the threshold, 
# - 2 for profiling all operations.
# When the profiler is disabled, db.setProfilingLevel() configures which slow operations are written to the diagnostic log.
# Log everything which takes longer than 30 milliseconds
db.setProfilingLevel(0, { slowms: 30 })

# find log messages related to slow operation
sudo grep "Slow query" /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | jq

vim /etc/mongod.conf
# Set the Verbosity Level for all components
systemLog:
  verbosity: 1

# set the verbosity level for a single component
...
systemLog:
  ...
  component:
    index:
      verbosity: 1
...  
sudo systemctl mongod restart
```

### MongoDB Server log rotation and retention

- Atlas
  - retains from all nodes log messages for 30 days
  - to access logs your user needs this role: 'Project Data Access Read Only' role
  - feature is available on M10+ clusters
  - The Performance Advisor retains at most 7 days of logs.

- Self-managed:

```bash
# Rotating Logs in mongosh
db.adminCommand( { logRotate : 1 } )
# Rotating Log alternatively, you can issue the SIGUSR1 signal to the mongod process
sudo kill -SIGUSR1 $(pidof mongod)
```

Rotation Strategies
- two types:
  - `rename` (MongoDB's default method) - default when using `mongod -v --logpath /var/log/mongodb/server1.log`
    - renames log with UTC timestamp
    - opens a new log
    - closes the old log
  - `reopen` - `mongod -v --logpath /var/log/mongodb/server1.log --logRotate reopen --logappend`
    - used in combination of `logrotate` linux service (required `logappend` option)

- MongoDB recommends you to automate log rotation
- performance issues if both `the log files` and `data files` are on the same disk

Automating Log Rotation with the Linux `logrotate` Service.
